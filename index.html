          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Translation</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            SPQR, an abbreviation for Senatus Populusque Romanus (Classical
            Latin: [s̠ɛˈnäːt̪ʊs̠ pɔpʊˈɫ̪ʊs̠kʷɛ roːˈmäːnʊs̠]; English: "The Senate and
            People of Rome"), is an emblematic abbreviated phrase referring to
            the government of the ancient Roman Republic. It appears on
            documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, in
            dedications of monuments and public works, and on some Roman
            currency.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The full phrase appears in Roman political, legal, and historical
            literature, such as the speeches of Cicero and Ab Urbe Condita Libri
            ("Books from the Founding of the City") of Livy.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The acronym SPQR encloses both of these figures, since it means
            Senatus PopulusQue Romanus, or "the Senate and the People of Rome".
            Since the times of the Republic, this acronym has appeared in the
            official coats of arms of Rome, wanting to enclose, through the
            Senate and the People, the entire citizenship of the City.

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Historical Context</h2>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The title's date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears
            in inscriptions of the Late Republic, from around 80 BC onwards.
            Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on
            coins, was simply ROMA. The abbreviation last appears on coins of
            Constantine the Great (ruled 312–337 AD), the first Roman emperor to
            support Christianity.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The two legal entities mentioned, Senātus and the Populus Rōmānus,
            are sovereign when combined. However, where populus is sovereign
            alone, Senātus is not. Under the Roman Kingdom, neither entity was
            sovereign. The phrase, therefore, can be dated to no earlier than
            the foundation of the Republic.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            This signature continued in use under the Roman Empire. The emperors
            were considered the de jure representatives of the people even
            though the senātūs consulta, or decrees of the Senate, were made at
            the de facto pleasure of the emperor.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Populus Rōmānus in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the
            government of the People. When the Romans named governments of
            foreign states, they used populus in the singular or plural, such as
            populī Prīscōrum Latīnōrum, "the governments of the Old Latins".
            Rōmānus is the established adjective used to distinguish the Romans,
            as in cīvis Rōmānus, "Roman citizen".

          <p class="paragraph">
            The Roman people appear very often in law and history in such
            phrases as dignitās, maiestās, auctoritās, lībertās populī Rōmānī,
            the "dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people". They
            were a populus līber, "a free people". There was an exercitus,
            imperium, iudicia, honorēs, consulēs, voluntās of this same populus:
            "the army, rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman
            people". They appear in early Latin as Popolus and Poplus, so the
            habit of thinking of themselves as free and sovereign was quite
            ingrained.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It
            could be said that similar language seen in more modern political
            and social revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in
            this sense meant the whole government. The latter, however, was
            essentially divided into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was
            executed by the consuls and praetors, and the comitia centuriāta,
            "committee of the centuries", whose will came to be safeguarded by
            the Tribunes.

            Beginning in 1184, the Commune of Rome struck coins in the name of
            the SENATVS P Q R. From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck
            coins with a shield inscribed SPQR.[1]
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            During the regime of Benito Mussolini, SPQR was emblazoned on a
            number of public buildings and manhole covers in an attempt to
            promote his dictatorship as a "New Roman Empire".

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Modern use</h2>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Even in contemporary usage, SPQR is still used in the municipal coat
            of arms of Rome and as abbreviation for the comune of Rome in
            official documents. The Italians have long used a different and
            humorous expansion of this abbreviation, "Sono Pazzi Questi Romani"
            (literally: "They're crazy, these Romans").SPQR is also part of the
            coat of arms of the Capital Military Command of the Italian army
            (Italian: Comando Militare Capitale).

            In business, in English-speaking countries, SPQR is sometimes
            (humorously) used to mean "Small Profits, Quick Returns", often by
            people who have studied Latin at school.
