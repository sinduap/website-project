        <p class="paragraph">
          SPQR, an abbreviation for Senatus Populusque Romanus (Classical Latin:
          [s̠ɛˈnäːt̪ʊs̠ pɔpʊˈɫ̪ʊs̠kʷɛ roːˈmäːnʊs̠]; English: "The Senate and People of
          Rome"), is an emblematic abbreviated phrase referring to the
          government of the ancient Roman Republic. It appears on documents made
          public by an inscription in stone or metal, in dedications of
          monuments and public works, and on some Roman currency.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The full phrase appears in Roman political, legal, and historical
          literature, such as the speeches of Cicero and Ab Urbe Condita Libri
          ("Books from the Founding of the City") of Livy.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The acronym SPQR encloses both of these figures, since it means
          Senatus PopulusQue Romanus, or "the Senate and the People of Rome".
          Since the times of the Republic, this acronym has appeared in the
          official coats of arms of Rome, wanting to enclose, through the Senate
          and the People, the entire citizenship of the City.

        <h2 class="heading-secondary">Historical Context</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The title's date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears in
          inscriptions of the Late Republic, from around 80 BC onwards.
          Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on
          coins, was simply ROMA. The abbreviation last appears on coins of
          Constantine the Great (ruled 312–337 AD), the first Roman emperor to
          support Christianity.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The two legal entities mentioned, Senātus and the Populus Rōmānus, are
          sovereign when combined. However, where populus is sovereign alone,
          Senātus is not. Under the Roman Kingdom, neither entity was sovereign.
          The phrase, therefore, can be dated to no earlier than the foundation
          of the Republic.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This signature continued in use under the Roman Empire. The emperors
          were considered the de jure representatives of the people even though
          the senātūs consulta, or decrees of the Senate, were made at the de
          facto pleasure of the emperor.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Populus Rōmānus in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the government
          of the People. When the Romans named governments of foreign states,
          they used populus in the singular or plural, such as populī Prīscōrum
          Latīnōrum, "the governments of the Old Latins". Rōmānus is the
          established adjective used to distinguish the Romans, as in cīvis
          Rōmānus, "Roman citizen".

        <p class="paragraph">
          The Roman people appear very often in law and history in such phrases
          as dignitās, maiestās, auctoritās, lībertās populī Rōmānī, the
          "dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people". They were
          a populus līber, "a free people". There was an exercitus, imperium,
          iudicia, honorēs, consulēs, voluntās of this same populus: "the army,
          rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman people". They
          appear in early Latin as Popolus and Poplus, so the habit of thinking
          of themselves as free and sovereign was quite ingrained.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It could
          be said that similar language seen in more modern political and social
          revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in this sense meant
          the whole government. The latter, however, was essentially divided
          into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was executed by the consuls
          and praetors, and the comitia centuriāta, "committee of the
          centuries", whose will came to be safeguarded by the Tribunes.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Beginning in 1184, the Commune of Rome struck coins in the name of the
          SENATVS P Q R. From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck coins
          with a shield inscribed SPQR.[1]
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          During the regime of Benito Mussolini, SPQR was emblazoned on a number
          of public buildings and manhole covers in an attempt to promote his
          dictatorship as a "New Roman Empire".
